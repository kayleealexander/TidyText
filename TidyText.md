[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. Working in RStudio, you can easy install R packages, such as the Tidyverse packages for data science. These packages (i.e. dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, etc.) facilitate data cleaning, analysis and visualization. R can also be used to analyze non-quantitative data, such as texts. In this workshop we will use the **[tidytext](https://www.tidytextmining.com/)** package (as well as others) to analyze and visualize written works, such as novels and song lyrics.

### 1. Getting Started

To begin, we need to open RStudio and create a new script.

-   Go to **File** → **New File** → **R Script**

For this workshop, you will be using the following packages:

1.  [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
2.  [tidytext](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidytext/vignettes/tidytext.html)
3.  [gutenbergr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gutenbergr/vignettes/intro.html)
4.  [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
5.  [ggthemes](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggthemes/versions/3.5.0)
6.  [stringr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stringr/vignettes/stringr.html)
7.  [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)

If you have not worked with these packages in RStudio before, you will need to install them. To install these packages in RStudio:

-   click select the **Packages** tab in the bottom right window
-   click **Install**
-   type in the names of the packages above (separated by a space or a comma)
-   click **Install**

### 2. Manually Loading Text & Creating a Data Frame

Text can be entered into RStudio manually and transformed into a data frame for analysis. You can separate multiple lines of text by separating each line with a comma ( , ). Go to your script window and type in the following code chunk:

``` r
text <- c("The time has come,' the Walrus said,",
          "To talk of many things:",
          "Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —",
          "Of cabbages — and kings —",
          "And why the sea is boiling hot —",
          "And whether pigs have wings.'")

text
```

    ## [1] "The time has come,' the Walrus said,"    
    ## [2] "To talk of many things:"                 
    ## [3] "Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —"
    ## [4] "Of cabbages — and kings —"               
    ## [5] "And why the sea is boiling hot —"        
    ## [6] "And whether pigs have wings.'"

Next, you will need to transform the value **text** into a **tibble** (data frame), which will allow you to perform text analysis. For this, you will use the **dplyr** package that you installed earlier. To use an installed package, you need to first load it into your R session. To load **dplyr**, run the following:

``` r
library(dplyr)
```

    ## 
    ## Attaching package: 'dplyr'

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
    ## 
    ##     filter, lag

    ## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
    ## 
    ##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union

Now you can create a data frame from the value you previously created. Run the following:

``` r
text_df <- data_frame(line = 1:6, text = text)
```

    ## Warning: `data_frame()` is deprecated, use `tibble()`.
    ## This warning is displayed once per session.

``` r
text_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 2
    ##    line text                                    
    ##   <int> <chr>                                   
    ## 1     1 The time has come,' the Walrus said,    
    ## 2     2 To talk of many things:                 
    ## 3     3 Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax —
    ## 4     4 Of cabbages — and kings —               
    ## 5     5 And why the sea is boiling hot —        
    ## 6     6 And whether pigs have wings.'

### 3. Text Tokenization

In order to perform more analysis on this text, we want to convert the data frame so that we have one token (in this case, a word) per document per row, a process called **tokenization**. Tokenizing text will retain the line number, remove punctuation, and default all words to lowercase characters.[1] For this, we will be using the **tidytext** package.

Load the **tidytext** package into the session, as we did with **dplyr**.

``` r
library(tidytext)
```

Then, run the following to tokenize:

``` r
text_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

    ## # A tibble: 35 x 2
    ##     line word  
    ##    <int> <chr> 
    ##  1     1 the   
    ##  2     1 time  
    ##  3     1 has   
    ##  4     1 come  
    ##  5     1 the   
    ##  6     1 walrus
    ##  7     1 said  
    ##  8     2 to    
    ##  9     2 talk  
    ## 10     2 of    
    ## # … with 25 more rows

You can replace the data in your environment with this new tibble by running the following:

``` r
text_df <- text_df %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

text_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 35 x 2
    ##     line word  
    ##    <int> <chr> 
    ##  1     1 the   
    ##  2     1 time  
    ##  3     1 has   
    ##  4     1 come  
    ##  5     1 the   
    ##  6     1 walrus
    ##  7     1 said  
    ##  8     2 to    
    ##  9     2 talk  
    ## 10     2 of    
    ## # … with 25 more rows

This is the format in which we can begin to analyze texts using R. In the next section, we will work with a larger text, and begin to perform some basic analyses and visualizations.

### 4. Analyzing Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein* (1831)

Project Gutenberg is a free database of eBooks, predominately texts for which the U.S. copyright has expired. These ebooks are available in a variety of formats, including Plain Text UTF-8, which we can easily use for text analysis in R. Each e-book has its own unique e-book number, which we can use with the package **gutenbergr** to automatically load the text into an RStudio environment. In this section, we will load and analyze the text of Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein* (e-book \# 42324).

Begin by loading the **gutenbergr** package into the session, as we did with **dplyr** and **tidytext**.

``` r
library(gutenbergr)
```

Then, run the following:

``` r
frankenstein <- gutenberg_download(c(42324))
```

    ## Determining mirror for Project Gutenberg from http://www.gutenberg.org/robot/harvest

    ## Using mirror http://aleph.gutenberg.org

``` r
frankenstein
```

    ## # A tibble: 7,631 x 2
    ##    gutenberg_id text                                                       
    ##           <int> <chr>                                                      
    ##  1        42324 "                             FRANKENSTEIN:"               
    ##  2        42324 ""                                                         
    ##  3        42324 "                                  OR,"                    
    ##  4        42324 ""                                                         
    ##  5        42324 "                         THE MODERN PROMETHEUS."          
    ##  6        42324 ""                                                         
    ##  7        42324 "                          BY MARY W. SHELLEY."            
    ##  8        42324 ""                                                         
    ##  9        42324 "            AUTHOR OF THE LAST MAN, PERKIN WARBECK, &c. &…
    ## 10        42324 ""                                                         
    ## # … with 7,621 more rows

If you look at the first few rows, you see that this also includes the novel’s front matter (i.e. title page, publishing info, introduction, etc.). If you were to examine the last rows, you would also see it includes additional publishing information and the transcriber’s notes. Since we’re only interested in analyzing Shelley’s novel, it would be useful to remove these rows.

Run the following to remove the front matter (rows 1-237) and back matter (rows 7620-7631):

``` r
frankenstein <- frankenstein[-c(1:237, 7620:7631), ]

frankenstein
```

    ## # A tibble: 7,382 x 2
    ##    gutenberg_id text                                                       
    ##           <int> <chr>                                                      
    ##  1        42324 PREFACE.                                                   
    ##  2        42324 ""                                                         
    ##  3        42324 ""                                                         
    ##  4        42324 The event on which this fiction is founded, has been suppo…

    ## # … with 7,372 more rows

Now we’re ready to tokenize. During this process, we can add an additional argument to order the words according to the word count. Run the following to create a new tibble with the tokenized text, ordered according to word count:

``` r
tidy_frankenstein <- frankenstein %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

tidy_frankenstein
```

    ## # A tibble: 7,117 x 2
    ##    word      n
    ##    <chr> <int>
    ##  1 the    4248
    ##  2 and    2993
    ##  3 i      2858
    ##  4 of     2684
    ##  5 to     2114
    ##  6 my     1781
    ##  7 a      1402
    ##  8 in     1141
    ##  9 was    1026
    ## 10 that   1020
    ## # … with 7,107 more rows

You may have noticed that these top used words don’t tell you too much about the text of Frankenstein. These types of words are called **stop words** (i.e. 'the', 'of', 'to', etc.). We can remove these types of words from our analysis by using the **anti\_join** function. Luckily, you won’t have to come up with a whole list of these words yourself; RStudio includes a preloaded package with a data frame, **stop\_words**, which contains English stop words compiled from three different lexicons.[2]

To remove the stop words from the **tidy\_frankenstein tibble**, you must first load the **stop\_words** data frame:

``` r
data("stop_words")
```

Now, you can remove the stop words from your data frame:

``` r
tidy_frankenstein <- tidy_frankenstein %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
tidy_frankenstein
```

    ## # A tibble: 6,637 x 2
    ##    word          n
    ##    <chr>     <int>
    ##  1 life        115
    ##  2 father      112
    ##  3 time        107
    ##  4 eyes        104
    ##  5 night        92
    ##  6 elizabeth    88
    ##  7 day          87
    ##  8 found        87
    ##  9 mind         86
    ## 10 heart        83
    ## # … with 6,627 more rows

### 5. Visualizing Mary Shelley's *Frankenstein* (1831)

We are now ready to plot the text of Frankenstein. To do this we will use the packages **ggplot2** and **ggthemes**. These packages are used to create data graphics, according to the Grammar of Graphics. This allows you to easily manipulate the design of your graphs, and to create the most visually appealing data visualizations in R.

First, we are going to plot the most commonly used words in Frankenstein. To do this, first load ggplot2 and ggthemes into your session.

``` r
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
```

Next, run the following to plot the words in *Frankenstein* that appear more than 50 times:

``` r
tidy_frankenstein %>%
  filter(n > 50) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) + 
  geom_col(fill = "darkred") + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  xlab(NULL) + 
  ylab("Word Count") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Word Usage in Frankenstein")
```

![](TidyText_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png)

This code chunk first calls the dataset that we would like to plot, then filters the dataset to only words that appear more than 50 times in the novel and orders the data according to the number of mentions. Then it calls **ggplot**, and plots **word** on the **x-axis** and **n** (word count) on the **y-axis**. **Geom\_col** tells R to use a bar chart with the value of the *y* variable (here, *n*), while the function **fill = “darkred”** colors in the bars.[3] **theme\_fivethirtyeight** is a pre-set design from the package [ggthemes](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggthemes/versions/3.5.0), which we then manipulate with the subsequent arguments to adjust the x-axis labels and y-axis labels, change the graph into a horizontal format, and add an appropriate title.

### 6. Sentiment Lexicons

One type of textual analysis that can be conducted using R is sentiment analysis in which the emotions of a given text or set of texts is examined. To conduct sentiment analysis, we can use sentiment lexicons. There are three lexicons that can be used for general sentiment analysis on English-language texts: **AFINN** (Finn Årup Nielsen), **bing** (Bing Liu et. Al) and **nrc** (Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney). These lexicons assign scores for positive and negative sentiment, and also emotions such as joy, anger, fear, etc.

-   **nrc** categorizes words as positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust.
-   **bing** categorizes words as positive or negative.
-   **AFINN** assigns words a numeric score between -5 and 5, where the negative scores indicate negative sentiment and positive scores indicate positive sentiment.

All three of these lexicons are included in the **sentiments** dataset, and **tidytext** provides the function **get\_sentiments( )**, which can be used to call specific lexicons. To call the **bing** lexicon, for example, run the following:

``` r
get_sentiments("bing")
```

    ## # A tibble: 6,788 x 2
    ##    word        sentiment
    ##    <chr>       <chr>    
    ##  1 2-faced     negative 
    ##  2 2-faces     negative 
    ##  3 a+          positive 
    ##  4 abnormal    negative 
    ##  5 abolish     negative 
    ##  6 abominable  negative 
    ##  7 abominably  negative 
    ##  8 abominate   negative 
    ##  9 abomination negative 
    ## 10 abort       negative 
    ## # … with 6,778 more rows

Now, call the **AFINN** sentiment lexicon.

``` r
get_sentiments("afinn")
```

    ## # A tibble: 2,476 x 2
    ##    word       score
    ##    <chr>      <int>
    ##  1 abandon       -2
    ##  2 abandoned     -2
    ##  3 abandons      -2
    ##  4 abducted      -2
    ##  5 abduction     -2
    ##  6 abductions    -2
    ##  7 abhor         -3
    ##  8 abhorred      -3
    ##  9 abhorrent     -3
    ## 10 abhors        -3
    ## # … with 2,466 more rows

Finally, call the **nrc** lexicon.

``` r
get_sentiments("nrc")
```

    ## # A tibble: 13,901 x 2
    ##    word        sentiment
    ##    <chr>       <chr>    
    ##  1 abacus      trust    
    ##  2 abandon     fear     
    ##  3 abandon     negative 
    ##  4 abandon     sadness  
    ##  5 abandoned   anger    
    ##  6 abandoned   fear     
    ##  7 abandoned   negative 
    ##  8 abandoned   sadness  
    ##  9 abandonment anger    
    ## 10 abandonment fear     
    ## # … with 13,891 more rows

These sentiment lexicons can be joined with your tokenized text(s) to conduct sentiment analysis by using the **inner\_join** function from the **dplyr** package.

Run the following code chunk to create a new data frame connecting the **bing** sentiment lexicon to the **tidy\_frankenstein** tibble you created earlier.

``` r
frankenstein_bing <- tidy_frankenstein %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"))
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
frankenstein_bing
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,473 x 3
    ##    word          n sentiment
    ##    <chr>     <int> <chr>    
    ##  1 death        80 negative 
    ##  2 miserable    65 negative 
    ##  3 love         59 positive 
    ##  4 misery       54 negative 
    ##  5 despair      49 negative 
    ##  6 happiness    49 positive 
    ##  7 happy        46 positive 
    ##  8 poor         45 negative 
    ##  9 joy          42 positive 
    ## 10 affection    41 positive 
    ## # … with 1,463 more rows

Now, let's use **ggplot2** to produce a horizontal bar chart showing positive and negative word usage in *Frankenstein* usiong the Bing et al. sentiment lexicon.

``` r
frankenstein_bing %>%
  filter(n > 25) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill=sentiment)) + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  geom_col() + 
  xlab(NULL) + 
  coord_flip() +
  ylab("Word Count") +
  ggtitle("Word Usage in Frankenstein", subtitle = "Sentiment Analysis Using Bing et al.")
```

![](TidyText_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png)

We can also use the **nrc** sentiment lexicon to get a better insight into how specific emotions play a role in a given text by filtering the data and joining it to your tokenized text. To see how fear appears in Frankenstein, run the following code chunks:

``` r
nrc_fear <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>%
  filter(sentiment == "fear")

nrc_fear
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,476 x 2
    ##    word        sentiment
    ##    <chr>       <chr>    
    ##  1 abandon     fear     
    ##  2 abandoned   fear     
    ##  3 abandonment fear     
    ##  4 abduction   fear     
    ##  5 abhor       fear     
    ##  6 abhorrent   fear     
    ##  7 abominable  fear     
    ##  8 abomination fear     
    ##  9 abortion    fear     
    ## 10 absence     fear     
    ## # … with 1,466 more rows

``` r
tidy_frankenstein %>%
  inner_join(nrc_fear)
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

    ## # A tibble: 493 x 3
    ##    word          n sentiment
    ##    <chr>     <int> <chr>    
    ##  1 death        80 fear     
    ##  2 misery       54 fear     
    ##  3 despair      49 fear     
    ##  4 horror       45 fear     
    ##  5 creature     43 fear     
    ##  6 fear         40 fear     
    ##  7 journey      37 fear     
    ##  8 possessed    36 fear     
    ##  9 fiend        32 fear     
    ## 10 monster      31 fear     
    ## # … with 483 more rows

Repeat this process looking at the words associated with **disgust**.

``` r
nrc_disgust <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>%
  filter(sentiment == "disgust")

nrc_disgust
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,058 x 2

### 7. Comparing Sentiment Lexicons

In performing sentiment analysis, it might be useful to compare how the use of a given lexicon impacts the analysis. In this section we will explore how the **AFINN**, **bing**, and **nrc** lexicons compare when we examine the narrative arc of *Frankenstein.* First, we will divide the text of *Frankenstein* into its narrative sections[4] using the package **stringr**. We will then use the **tidyr** package to bind the sections to the different sentiment lexicons while manipulating the nrc and bing sentiment lexicons to match the numeric scoring used by the AFINN lexicon.

First, load the **stringr** and **tidyr** packages into your session.

``` r
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
```

Then, run the following code chunk to section off the text of *Frankenstein* according to each letter or chapter.

``` r
frankenstein_sections <- frankenstein %>%
  mutate(section = 
           cumsum(str_detect(text,regex("^chapter|letter [\\divxlc]",
                                        ignore_case = TRUE)))) %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
frankenstein_sections
```

    ## # A tibble: 27,543 x 3
    ##    gutenberg_id section word         
    ##           <int>   <int> <chr>        
    ##  1        42324       0 preface      
    ##  2        42324       0 event        
    ##  3        42324       0 fiction      
    ##  4        42324       0 founded      
    ##  5        42324       0 supposed     
    ##  6        42324       0 dr           
    ##  7        42324       0 darwin       
    ##  8        42324       0 physiological
    ##  9        42324       0 writers      
    ## 10        42324       0 germany      
    ## # … with 27,533 more rows

Now, run the following to create a tibble summarizing the total sentiment score (according to the AFINN lexicon) per section of *Frankenstein*.

``` r
frankenstein_afinn <- frankenstein_sections %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn")) %>%
  group_by(index = section) %>%
  summarize(sentiment = sum(score)) %>%
  mutate(method = "AFINN")
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
frankenstein_afinn
```

    ## # A tibble: 30 x 3
    ##    index sentiment method
    ##    <int>     <int> <chr> 
    ##  1     0        23 AFINN 
    ##  2     1        66 AFINN 
    ##  3     2        61 AFINN 
    ##  4     3        27 AFINN 
    ##  5     4        -2 AFINN 
    ##  6     5        81 AFINN 
    ##  7     6        62 AFINN 
    ##  8     7         1 AFINN 
    ##  9     8        38 AFINN 
    ## 10     9         2 AFINN 
    ## # … with 20 more rows

Next, create a tibble joining the **bing** and **nrc** lexicons to **frankenstein\_sections**, and converting the binary values "positive" and "negative" to a numeric score comparable to the **AFINN** lexicon.

``` r
frankenstein_bingnrc <- bind_rows(frankenstein_sections %>%
                                    inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
                                    mutate(method = "Bing et al."),
                                  frankenstein_sections %>%
                                    inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc") %>%
                                                 filter(sentiment %in%
                                                          c("positive",
                                                            "negative"))) %>%
                                    mutate(method = "NRC")) %>%
  count(method, index = section, sentiment) %>%
  spread(sentiment, n, fill = 0) %>%
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"
    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
frankenstein_bingnrc
```

    ## # A tibble: 60 x 5
    ##    method      index negative positive sentiment
    ##    <chr>       <int>    <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ##  1 Bing et al.     0       16       20         4
    ##  2 Bing et al.     1       32       58        26
    ##  3 Bing et al.     2       49       72        23
    ##  4 Bing et al.     3       10       15         5
    ##  5 Bing et al.     4      113       94       -19
    ##  6 Bing et al.     5       60       89        29
    ##  7 Bing et al.     6       84      102        18
    ##  8 Bing et al.     7       90       81        -9
    ##  9 Bing et al.     8      103       99        -4
    ## 10 Bing et al.     9      111       64       -47
    ## # … with 50 more rows

Now we can plot the **frankenstein\_afinn** and **frankenstein\_bingnrc** tibbles together using **ggplot2**.

``` r
bind_rows(frankenstein_afinn, 
          frankenstein_bingnrc) %>%
  ggplot(aes(index, sentiment, fill = method)) + 
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~method, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  xlab("Index") + 
  ylab("Sentiment Score") +
  ggtitle("Sentiment in Frankenstein per Chapter", subtitle = "Comparing Lexicons")
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

![](TidyText_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png)

Discrepancies among sentiment scores can be due to the ways in which sentiment is categorized in or scored, as well as which words appear or do not appear in each lexicon. To understand these lexicons further, you can count the number of positive and negative words included in each. To look further into **nrc**, run the following:

``` r
get_sentiments("nrc") %>%
  filter(sentiment %in% c("positive",
                          "negative")) %>%
  count(sentiment)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 2
    ##   sentiment     n
    ##   <chr>     <int>
    ## 1 negative   3324
    ## 2 positive   2312

Now, examine **bing**.

``` r
get_sentiments("bing") %>%
  count(sentiment)
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 2
    ##   sentiment     n
    ##   <chr>     <int>
    ## 1 negative   4782
    ## 2 positive   2006

It is also useful to know how much each word contributes to the overall sentiment of the book. To do this, we can create and plot a tibble joining a given lexicon to the text and creating a variable *n* to indicate the word count.

To create the tibble, run the following code chunk:

``` r
frank_bingcounts <- frankenstein_sections %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
frank_bingcounts
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,473 x 3
    ##    word      sentiment     n
    ##    <chr>     <chr>     <int>
    ##  1 death     negative     80
    ##  2 miserable negative     65
    ##  3 love      positive     59
    ##  4 misery    negative     54
    ##  5 despair   negative     49
    ##  6 happiness positive     49
    ##  7 happy     positive     46
    ##  8 poor      negative     45
    ##  9 joy       positive     42
    ## 10 affection positive     41
    ## # … with 1,463 more rows

To plot:

``` r
frank_bingcounts %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  top_n(20) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_y") + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  ggtitle("Words' Contribution to Sentiment in Frankenstein", subtitle = "Using the Bing et. al Lexicon")
```

    ## Selecting by n

![](TidyText_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png)

Now, let's plot the contrubution to sentiment that positive and negative words in *Frankenstein* have using the nrc lexicon. (Note: you will have to include a filter to only include the categories “positive” and “negative.”)

Create the tibble:

``` r
frank_nrccounts <- frankenstein_sections %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc")) %>%
  filter(sentiment %in% c("positive",
                          "negative")) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
frank_nrccounts
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,707 x 3
    ##    word      sentiment     n
    ##    <chr>     <chr>     <int>
    ##  1 found     positive     87
    ##  2 death     negative     80
    ##  3 dear      positive     72
    ##  4 friend    positive     71
    ##  5 miserable negative     65
    ##  6 love      positive     59
    ##  7 misery    negative     54
    ##  8 words     negative     54
    ##  9 hope      positive     51
    ## 10 despair   negative     49
    ## # … with 1,697 more rows

Plot:

``` r
frank_nrccounts %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  top_n(20) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_y") + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  ggtitle("Words' Contribution to Sentiment in Frankenstein", subtitle = "Using the NRC Lexicon")
```

### 8. Analyzing Queen Lyrics

In this section we will experiment with using sentiment analysis on song lyrics. To begin, we will import the Queen.csv file containing all of the lyrics to songs by the band Queen.

First, load the **Queen.csv** file into your environment.

``` r
queen <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kayleealexander/TidyText/master/Queen.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

queen
```

    ##                                                                                                                 text

Next, we will need to tokenize the lyrics, and group them per song.

``` r
queen <- queen %>%
  group_by(song) %>%
  ungroup()%>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)

queen
```

    ## # A tibble: 44,521 x 2
    ##    song      word  
    ##    <chr>     <chr> 
    ##  1 It's Late you   
    ##  2 It's Late say   
    ##  3 It's Late you   
    ##  4 It's Late love  
    ##  5 It's Late me    
    ##  6 It's Late and   
    ##  7 It's Late i     
    ##  8 It's Late hardly
    ##  9 It's Late know  
    ## 10 It's Late your  
    ## # … with 44,511 more rows

Now let’s count the most common words in Queen lyrics. Create a tibble for words in Queen lyrics, sorted by word count and with stop words removed.

``` r
tidy_queen <- queen %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
tidy_queen
```

    ## # A tibble: 3,018 x 2
    ##    word      n
    ##    <chr> <int>
    ##  1 love    469
    ##  2 yeah    354
    ##  3 time    219
    ##  4 day     148
    ##  5 baby    141
    ##  6 hey     139
    ##  7 live    139
    ##  8 life    138
    ##  9 gonna   134
    ## 10 heart   120
    ## # … with 3,008 more rows

Song lyrics often include words such as “yeah” and “hey,” which you might want to exclude from your analysis.[5] You can create a custom stop words list by running the following:

``` r
lyric_stop_words <- bind_rows(data_frame(word = 
                                           c("yeah","baby","hey", "la","oooh",
                                             "ah","ooh"),
                                         lexicon = c("custom")), stop_words)

lyric_stop_words
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,156 x 2
    ##    word  lexicon
    ##    <chr> <chr>  
    ##  1 yeah  custom 
    ##  2 baby  custom 
    ##  3 hey   custom 
    ##  4 la    custom 
    ##  5 oooh  custom 
    ##  6 ah    custom 
    ##  7 ooh   custom 
    ##  8 a     SMART  
    ##  9 a's   SMART  
    ## 10 able  SMART  
    ## # … with 1,146 more rows

Use the **anti\_join()** function to remove your custom stop words from **tidy\_queen**.

``` r
tidy_queen <- tidy_queen %>%
  anti_join(lyric_stop_words)
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
tidy_queen
```

    ## # A tibble: 3,011 x 2
    ##    word      n
    ##    <chr> <int>
    ##  1 love    469
    ##  2 time    219

Now, use **ggplot2** to plot the most common words in Queen lyrics that are used more than 60 times.

``` r
tidy_queen %>%
  filter(n > 60) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n)) + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  geom_col() + 
  xlab(NULL) + 
  coord_flip() +
  ggtitle("Word Frequency in Queen Lyrics")
```

### 9. Analyzing Sentiment in Queen Lyrics

Now that we have an overview of the data, we can begin to apply some sentiment analysis. Use the **inner\_join()** function to **create a new tibble** connecting the **queen** dataframe to both the **AFINN** lexicon *and* your existing **tidy\_queen** dataframe.

``` r
queen_afinn <- queen %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn")) %>%
  inner_join(tidy_queen)
```

    ## Joining, by = "word"
    ## Joining, by = "word"

``` r
queen_afinn
```

    ## # A tibble: 3,071 x 4
    ##    song      word    score     n
    ##    <chr>     <chr>   <int> <int>
    ##  1 It's Late love        3   469
    ##  2 It's Late love        3   469
    ##  3 It's Late blame      -2     6
    ##  4 It's Late love        3   469
    ##  5 It's Late feeling     1    48
    ##  6 It's Late steal      -2     2
    ##  7 It's Late crying     -2     6
    ##  8 It's Late love        3   469
    ##  9 It's Late love        3   469
    ## 10 It's Late true        2    25
    ## # … with 3,061 more rows

Now, plot this new tibble using **ggplot2** to create a horizontal bar chart showing all words in Queen lyrics occurring more than 30 times, ordered on word count and filled according to their AFINN sentiment score.

``` r
queen_afinn %>%
  filter(n > 30) %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, fill=score)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  xlab(NULL) + 
  coord_flip() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + 
  ggtitle("Word Frequency and Sentiment in Queen Songs", subtitle = "Using the AFINN Lexicon")
```

![](TidyText_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png)

Now, let's create a data frame summarizing the AFINN sentiment score per song.

``` r
queen_songs <- queen_afinn %>%
  group_by(index = song) %>%
  summarize(sentiment = sum(score))
```

Then, plot this new data frame using **ggplot2**.

``` r
queen_songs %>%
  mutate(index = reorder(index, sentiment)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(index, sentiment, fill = sentiment)) + 
  geom_col() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Total Sentiment Score") +
  ylim(-100,200) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.line.y = element_line(),
        panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  ggtitle("Songs by Queen", 
          subtitle = "Sentiment Analysis Using the AFINN Lexicon")
```

![](TidyText_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-44-1.png)

We now see each song represented by a bar along the *x-axis*, with the *y-axis* value representing the total AFINN score per Queen song (sum of the scores given for each word in the song). It is difficult, however, to see which bars represent which songs. Let's explore the data to get some insight:

-   Click on **queen\_songs** in the list of **Data** in your **Global Environment**.
-   This pulls up a window showing your data frame.
-   Sort the songs according to their sentiment score by clicking the arrows in the upper right corner of the cell with the column name sentiment.

You can now see the songs ordered according to their sum sentiment score. We can use this view to get a better insight into which songs in our visualization are represented in which areas of the graph. We can then add annotations to the graph to show the highest and lowest scoring songs, as well as the more neutral scoring songs to help the viewer understand better what the graph might represent. Annotations need to be added to the graph by specifying the coordinates at which you would like them to appear. You can adjust the coordinates easily by playing with the values in order to get the text situated at the precise point you’d like it to. To add annotations (text and arrows) for the highest, lowest, and most neutral Queen songs to your visualization, run the following:

``` r
queen_songs %>%
  mutate(index = reorder(index, sentiment)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(index, sentiment, fill = sentiment)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  theme_fivethirtyeight() +
  xlab(NULL) +
  ylab("Total Sentiment Score") +
  ylim(-100,200) +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.line.y = element_line(),
        panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  ggtitle("Songs by Queen", 
          subtitle = "Sentiment Analysis Using the AFINN Lexicon") +
  annotate("text", label = "''How Funny Love Is''", 
           size = 3, color = "black", fontface = 2,
           x = 160, y = 150) +
  annotate("segment", x = 178, xend = 190, y = 150, yend = 150, 
           colour = "red", 
           size=.5, arrow=arrow(length = unit(.1, "inches"))) +
  annotate("text", label = "''Liar''", 
           size = 3, color = "black", fontface = 2,
           x = 18, y = -78) +
    annotate("segment", x = 13, xend = 1, y = -78, yend = -78, 
           colour = "red", 
           size=.5, arrow=arrow(length = unit(.1, "inches"))) +
  annotate("text", label = "''Some Day One Day''", 
           size = 3, color = "black", fontface = 2,
           x = 82, y = 53) +
      annotate("segment", x = 83, xend = 83, y = 45, yend = 1, 
           colour = "red", 
           size=.5, arrow=arrow(length = unit(.1, "inches"))) +
  annotate("text", label = "''A Kind of Magic''", 
           size = 3, color = "black", fontface = 2,
           x = 77, y = -50) +
      annotate("segment", x = 77, xend = 77, y = -45, yend = -1, 
           colour = "red", 
           size=.5, arrow=arrow(length = unit(.1, "inches")))
```

The visualization has now been reproduced with 8 annotations (4 arrows, 4 texts). The size, style, and position of each annotation can be adjusted by changing the values within the parenthesis for **size**, **color**, **fontface**, **x**, **xend**, **y**, and **yend**. Feel free to adjust these settings, or add additional annotations to the chart based on the data frame.
