"You say you love me, and I hardly know your name",It's Late
And if I say I love you in the candlelight,It's Late
There's no-one but myself to blame,It's Late
"But there's something inside, that's turning my mind away",It's Late
"Oh how I could love you, if I could let you stay",It's Late
"It's late, but I'm bleeding deep inside",It's Late
"It's late, is it just my sickly pride?",It's Late
"Too late, even now the feeling seems to steal away",It's Late
"So late, though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say",It's Late
"It's late, it's late, it's late",It's Late
But not too late,It's Late
"The way you love me, is the sweetest love around",It's Late
"But after all this time, the more I'm trying",It's Late
The more I seem to let you down,It's Late
"Now you tell me you're leaving, and I just can't believe it's true",It's Late
"Oh you know that I can love you, though I know I can't be true",It's Late
"Oh you made me love you, don't tell me that we're through",It's Late
"It's late, but it's driving me so mad",It's Late
"It's late, yes I know but don't try to tell me that it's",It's Late
"Too late, save our love you can't turn out the lights",It's Late
"So late, I've been wrong but I'll learn to be right",It's Late
"It's late, it's late, it's late",It's Late
But not too late,It's Late
I've been so long - You've been so long,It's Late
We've been so long trying to work it out,It's Late
I ain't got long - You ain't got long,It's Late
We gotta know what this life is all about,It's Late
Too late much too late,It's Late
You're staring at me,It's Late
"With suspicion in your eye, you say what game are you playing?",It's Late
"What's this that you're saying?, I know that I can't reply",It's Late
"If I take you tonight, is it making my life a lie?",It's Late
"Oh you make me wonder, did I live my life alright?",It's Late
"It's late, but it's time to set me free",It's Late
"It's late, yes I know but there's no way it has to be",It's Late
"Too late, so let the fire take our bodies this night",It's Late
"So late, so let the waters take our guilt in the tide",It's Late
"It's late, it's late, it's late, it's late",It's Late
"It's late, it's late, it's all too late",It's Late
"Okay, we're gonna fool around a bit, come on",You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)
You don't like crazy things,You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)
You don't like rockin' baby,You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)
You just wanna go to the movie show,You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)

You're so square (baby I don't care),You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)
"Do wop, do wop",You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care)

It's the sad eyed goodbye Yesterday's moments I remember,Drowse
"It's the bleak street,week kneed partings I recall",Drowse
It's the mistier mists the hazier days,Drowse
The brighter sun and the easier lays,Drowse
There's all the more reason for laughing and crying,Drowse
When you're younger and life isn't to hard at all,Drowse
"It's the fantastic drowse, of the afternoon Sundays",Drowse
"That bored you to rages of tears, the unending pleadings",Drowse
"To waste all your good times, In thoughts of your middle-aged years",Drowse
It's the vertical hold all the things that you're told,Drowse
"For the everyday hero it all turns to zero, and there's all the more reason",Drowse
"For living or dying when you're young, and your troubles are all very small",Drowse
"Out here on the street we'd gather and meet, and scuff up the sidewalk",Drowse
"With endlessly restless feet, half on the time we'd broaden our minds",Drowse
"More in the pool hall, than we did in the school hall",Drowse
With the down town chewing gum bums,Drowse
watching the night life the lights and the fun,Drowse
"Never wanted to be the boy next door, always thought I'd be something more",Drowse
"But it ain't easy for a small town boy, It ain't easy at all",Drowse
"Thinking it right and doing it wrong, It's easier from an arm chair",Drowse
Waves of alternatives wash over my sleepiness,Drowse
Have my eggs poached for breakfast I guess,Drowse
"I think I'll be Clint Eastwood, Jimi Hendrix he was good",Drowse
"Let's try William the Conqueror, now who else do I like?",Drowse
Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know,Scandal
Scandal - they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show,Scandal
"They'll see the heart ache,they'll see the love break",Scandal
"They'll hear me pleading,We'll say for God's sake",Scandal
Over and over and over again,Scandal
Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds,Scandal
Hey scandal - and all the world can make us out to be fools,Scandal
"Here come the bad news,open the flood gates",Scandal
"They'll leave us bleeding,we'll say you cheapskates",Scandal
Over and over and over again,Scandal
So let them know when they start it's just a private affair,Scandal
They'll have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care,Scandal
It's only a life to be twisted and broken,Scandal
"They'll see the heart ache,they'll see our love break - yeah",Scandal
"They'll hear me pleading,I'll say for God's sake",Scandal
Over and over and over and over again,Scandal
Scandal scandal,Scandal
Scandal,Scandal
Scandal yes you're breaking my heart again,Scandal
Scandal yes you're loving on out again,Scandal
Today the headlines tomorrow hard times,Scandal
And no-one ever really knows the truth from the lies,Scandal
And in the end the story deeper must hide,Scandal
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside,Scandal
Scandal scandal,Scandal
Scandal scandal,Scandal

There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore,Pain Is So Close To Pleasure
Some days you're feeling good some days you're feeling bad,Pain Is So Close To Pleasure
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad,Pain Is So Close To Pleasure
Let the sweetness of love wipe the tears from your face,Pain Is So Close To Pleasure
