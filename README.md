## Workshop: Introduction to Text Analysis with TidyText

This is an introduction into text analysis using primarily the TidyText package for R statistical programming language in the RStudio development environment. This workshop will demonstrate how to import texts into the environment, and perform basic analyses for word usage and sentiment analysis. This workshop uses the [tidytext](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) package (as well as others) to analyze and visualize written works, such as novels and song lyrics.
